# About

Thanks for installing FNSwitch, an application designed to easily switch between FN (F1-F12 keys) and the icons apple includes on them instead. This is useful if you play games that require the use of the F1-F12 keys, no one wants to have to press FN and the F1-F12 key when they could just press the key itself. When you’re done gaming, however, it’s nice to be able to adjust the volume and brightness without having to press FN. This is where FNSwitch comes in to play, it can help make the task of switching between modes a little easier. 

# Setup  

all you have to do is give FNSwitch access from System Preferences to be able to function properly. 

1) Try to open FNSwitch, when it fails, open “System Preferences,” then select “Security and Privacy," under "General" -> Allow Apps downloaded from, and next to FN Switch, select "allow anyway." If you're having trouble or want to read more on this:

2) Select the “Privacy” tab from the top navigation bar, then select the “Accessibility” tab from the left sidebar, then click the lock icon to authenticate so you can make changes to the Accessibility settings.

3) Authenticate using an admin username and password

4) Select the checkbox to the left of “FNSwitch” to give FNSwitch permission to change your modifier key settings, and you’re all done, now you can use FNSwitch to easily switch between modifier key modes.
